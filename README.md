The GTA Application Submission System aims to modernize and streamline the collection, management, and matching process of Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) applications within the UMKC Computer Science department. The system caters to two distinct user roles: students and administrators. 
Users, whether students or administrators, can easily view available jobs and categorize them by types. To apply for a specific position, a user must be logged in, with the added capability to monitor their application status through a dedicated tab or page.              
Administrators, when logged in, gain access to a comprehensive list of job postings. They possess the authority to create, edit, delete, and modify the status of a job as needed. The system securely stores both user and admin data in a database.                         
Admin users hold the privilege to alter the status of a job applicant and access all pertinent information related to applicants. This full-stack development project leverages Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, utilizing the EJS extension with layouts for enhanced functionality and user experience.
